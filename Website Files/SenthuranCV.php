    <h2>Personal Details</h2>
    <p> My name is Senthuran Ambalavanar. I am from Sri Lanka. I was born on 16th of January 1996. My hometown is Jaffna,
        and Iâ€™m living in Colombo with my family. I'm the eldest son in my family, which consists of four members. My father
        is the Deputy General Manager of Call Center, Sri Lanka Telecom and my mother is a house wife. I have a younger brother
        who will be completing his secondary education very soon. I have completed my school education in Royal College,
        Colombo in 2015. </p>
    <h2>Education Details</h2>
    <p> I got through my primary education and secondary education in Royal College, Colombo. I have obtained 7 As and 2
        B s in my Ordinary Level examinations, and an A and 2 C s with a good Z score in my Advanced Level examinations.
        Currently I am following BEng(Hons) in Software Engineering degree program in Informatics Institute of Technology.</p>
    <h2>Professional Details</h2>
    <p> I would like to particularly pursue my software engineering career, in web developing and technology. Modules, I am
        currently following have given me a strong foundation about programming. I am also a freelancer, who is being evolved
         in graphic designing and video editing.</p>
    <h2>Personal Skills</h2>
    <p>I am a person with great enthusiasm towards exploration and learning new skills. I was a computer enthusiast from my small ages.I had interest on programming, as well as in graphic designing. Time management and being able to work under deadlines,
        ability of working as a team, punctuality, responsibility and being energetic are some of my strengths, which help me in
        evolving and completing given activities on time and at the topmost exemplars.</p>

    <h2>Personal interests</h2>
    <p> Being a creative person too, I show interest towards Graphic designing and video editing. The above two are some of the
        instances where science meets art. Understanding the visual mind of people, and creating something which would turn on
        various thoughts are very interesting things, which I tend to do. These activities help me to refresh my thoughts, and to
        gain some extra skills such as time management.</p>
